# Images Directory

This directory contains all image assets for the RA Finance Dashboard.

## Structure
- Place all image files (.png, .jpg, .svg, etc.) in this directory
- Images will be imported and used to replace localhost URLs

## Usage
Images can be imported in React components like:
```javascript
import imageName from '../assets/images/image-file.png';
```

## Current Assets to Replace
The following localhost URLs need to be replaced with local images:
- Header icons (search, share, plus, bell, calendar, etc.)
- User avatar
- Sidebar icons (dashboard, performance, cards, etc.)
- Logo and branding elements
- Credit card background and elements
- Any other visual assets

## Instructions
1. Add image files to this directory
2. Update component imports to use local files instead of localhost URLs
3. Ensure proper file naming conventions (kebab-case recommended)
